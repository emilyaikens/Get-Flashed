## Project Hurdles and Wins

* The largest hurdle for me was figuring out the flow of data between front-end and back-end. As always, my whiteboard was my best friend during this project! The creation of flow-charts helped me immensly. The beginning was quite slow because I console logged just about everything; I wanted to have a very clear idea of what was happening every stop of the way. After completing a few pathways, I began to understand the flow of the MERN stack. From there, everything was much more efficient. As per usual, the largest hurdle for me was also the largest win. Gaining an understanding of the MERN stack was incredibly rewarding because I had to work so hard at it. I look forward to understanding it in greater depth. 

* For our project we were encouraged to set up the front and back end in the same app to reduce the chances of cors errors. This seems to be somewhat unsual in the "real world", as it does not allow the front end to be tailored to different devices. Our particualr configuration meant that advice from StackOverflow and the dev community at large was tailored towards a different setup. This was often a hinderance, but in the end, I learned a lot about both ways to configure a MERN app and feel like I have a better understanding of this stack as a result.
